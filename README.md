# `scrapmetal`: Scrap Your Rust Boilerplate

Generic transformations, queries, and mutations for Rust without the
boilerplate.

A port of the ideas and code
from
["Scrap Your Boilerplate: A Practical Design Pattern for Generic Programming" by Lämmel and Peyton Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/hmap.pdf) to
Rust.

⚠ Depends on the specialization nightly Rust feature. ⚠
