# `scrapmetal`: Scrap Your Rust Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/scrapmetal.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/scrapmetal) [![`scrapmetal` on crates.io][https://img.shields.io/crates/v/scrapmetal.svg]](https://crates.io/crates/scrapmetal)

Generic transformations, queries, and mutations for Rust without the
boilerplate.

A port of the ideas and code
from
["Scrap Your Boilerplate: A Practical Design Pattern for Generic Programming" by Lämmel and Peyton Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/hmap.pdf) to
Rust.

⚠ Depends on the specialization nightly Rust feature. ⚠
